Topic of the project:                           
Scorched Earth is a turn-based artillery game, where a player and a computer are trying destroy each other in a 2D terrain. Both the angle and the power of the tank turret can be adjusted before each shot. The enemy is one or more tank turrets controlled by the computer. The maps and the positions of tank turrets are usually randomly generated.
